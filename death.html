            <h1>About Death Note</h1>
        </center>
        <p>Death Note (stylized as DEATH NOTE) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by
            Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death
            Note", which belonged to the Shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone
            whose name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death
            Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free
            society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite
            Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him. Death Note ran in Shueisha's
            manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006. Its 108 chapters were collected in 12
            tankōbon volumes.

            A 37-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Madhouse and directed by Tetsurō Araki, was
            broadcast in Japan on Nippon Television from October 2006 to June 2007. A light novel based on the series,
            written by Nisio Isin, was also released in 2006. Additionally, various video games have been published by
            Konami for the Nintendo DS. The series was adapted into three live action films released in Japan in June
            2006, November 2006, and February 2008, and a television drama in 2015. A miniseries titled Death Note: New
            Generation and a fourth film were released in 2016. An American film adaptation was released exclusively on
            Netflix in August 2017 and a sequel is reportedly in the works.

        <p>Death Note’s protagonist Light Yagami is an example of one of the extremes on this spectrum. He is an
            all-around perfect student—athletic, smart, handsome, and outwardly kind. He is an actor and a liar with a
            superiority complex, and prior to when the plot picks up in the anime, his attitude towards life is that of
            a person playing a meaningless game that he knows all the cheat codes to. Life is boring, and more than
            that, it is a rotten place full of despicable people.

            But then, he finds a Death Note, a notebook that shinigami, also known as death gods or grim reapers, use to
            kill people. The Death Note simply requires the owner to write a person’s name in the notebook in order to
            kill that particular person. The notebook kills a person through heart attack if no cause of death is
            specified. When Light finds the notebook, he doesn’t behave like one might expect from a show meant to
            entertain. Rather than completely shun the notebook or open it up and try it out immediately out of
            curiosity and doubt, he behaves with caution and intelligence from the beginning. He ultimately decides to
            kill a criminal whose life no one would care about. This quickly accelerates into creating Light’s god
            complex, where he believes he can purge the world of evil by killing criminals.</p>
